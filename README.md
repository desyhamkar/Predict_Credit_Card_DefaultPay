Predict Credit Card Default Payment
Final Project of Data Mining Course - Big Data Analysis

A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate if one could predict for them who is gonna get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction

This dataset is from a website with the URL as https://leaps.analyttica.com/home. Now, this dataset consists of 10,000 customers mentioning their age, salary, marital_status, credit card limit, credit card category, etc. There are nearly 18 features.

From this data set we can predict the customers who are going to stop using credit cards. Using this model/result, the company can make offer to employess to retain them.
